# Cocktail Explorer

Cocktail Explorer is a web application developed using **Next.js 14** and **React 18**. This project includes various adjustments for user authentication processes.

## Project Overview

- **Authentication:** The user authentication system is developed using a combination of Next.js and React. **Vercel PostgreSQL** is utilized for this setup.

- **Cookie and Session Management:** Cookies and session configurations have been implemented to ensure secure user sessions.

- **Components:** Both Server Side and Client Side components have been prepared, allowing the application to adapt to various scenarios and user interactions.

- **State Management:** The application uses **Redux** for state management across the app. Redux ensures consistent and easy management of states between components.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
